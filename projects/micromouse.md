CyberPatriot is a national cyber security competition run by the US Air Force made to encourage students to learn and apply cyber security skills. I was part of a team of students who all worked together to compete. The competition took place over multiple hours, over multiple machines. The team is responsible for ensuring the security of a windows and ubuntu machine, while also working on a cisco server to ensure security.

Each part of our team specialized in a certain machine, while also learning about the other machines to be able to check over eachothers work. I was responsible for the cisco servers, while also working on windows mainly. The ubuntu server took a much larger time investment, and so I mainly assisted in ensuring the windows machine was working properly if I had any time after the cisco cerver.
