<p>The Hawaii Undergraduate Initiative is a program at the University of Hawaii at Manoa made to help incoming freshman better integrate into college life. Run by fellow college students, it is made to provide opportunities for community and resources that help better deal with the sudden change that is college. I was elected director of professional development for this program, and put in charge of organizing events to help with the professional side of college.
Most of my job was finding speakers or activities that could best help incoming freshment. Most of what I did was presenting online resources to the students that could help with specific aspects of student life. I also organized a speaker from one of Hawaiiâ€™s top trade schools to show the many avenues available to them.
The technical side of my job was mainly data collection and analysys. I had to put together surveys to best gather what the incoming freshmen needed, and then using that data, I had to find the proper resources and ensure that the information and people could be available when needed.</p>
