When relatives find out I know how to code, I am often asked about making websites. Sometimes they ask if I can, sometimes they want to see ones I've made, but to be honest, I never learned how to do any of that. I was completely lost when beginning to learn this, as the goal of this code was visual. When I code, I usually code to solve a puzzle. I want the code to output specific data, and so I think about it like a game, with different logic to apply. Web development is a totally different beast.
