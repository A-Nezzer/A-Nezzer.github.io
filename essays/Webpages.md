When relatives find out I know how to code, I am often asked about making websites. Sometimes they ask if I can, sometimes they want to see ones I've made, but to be honest, I never learned how to do any of that. I was completely lost when beginning to learn this, as the goal of this code was visual. When I code, I usually code to solve a puzzle. I want the code to output specific data, and so I think about it like a game, with different logic to apply. Web development is a totally different beast. If the other coding I did was a logic puzzle, this was a jigsaw puzzle. It still was a puzzle, but I had to approach it completely differently. It wasn't a game, I wasn't solving a problem, I was simply finding the code that I needed and slotting it in. While it is technically easier, as there is less problem solving, for me this is much harder to learn, as there is very little that interests me. This is definitely an impressive skill, learning and applying the vast array of HTML and CSS is something I don't think I'll ever do well, but it is much more a test of visual design and memorization, two things I struggle at in all aspects of life. I now have a basic understanding, and I could probably put together a website for a relative if need be, but I am much more excited to see where we are going from here.
