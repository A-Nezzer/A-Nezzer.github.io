When it comes to learning, there will always come a time when the information provided is not enough. At that time, the best way to move forward is to ask for help. There are risks to that, though, because asking the wrong person the wrong thing can prevent you from learning anything, or even worse, can simply teach you incorrect information. That's why its key to properly ask for help, and know where is best for asking for that help.
When it comes to coding, one of the best sources of coding help comes from the forum Stack Overflow, where coders around the world come together to ask and answer questions. You can go there for help with both coding and to see how to best ask questions. A proper question is so important that Stack Overflow will close questions, not allowing answers, if they are badly asked. This does not mean there are some high, hard to meet standards, but it does mean you have to put some effort in yourself before you get outside help. For example, a proper question posed to Stack Overflow, linked below, is short and specific, asking for help but not in any general way. The person asking for help had a problem removing a property from an object, could not figure out how, and so asked. They provide a specific example of the action they are trying to achieve and as such they are given a specific answer that is easy to understand and use. When clear and specific with what you are struggling with, people are much more likely to be able to respond clearly and specifically.
If you want an example of a bad question, the easiest way to find one is to search for the term "homework". Many students post their entire assignments, and just ask "What's wrong?" They don't show error codes, don't specify what part of the code they are working on, they just want the work to be done for them. The question posed in the linked example below was basically, "It doesn't work" and as such all the responses are in kind. They don't know what part does not work, they don't know what the goal is, and so they tell the poster to take down his question and to make a more specific and understandable question. Bad questions don't help you understand your problems properly, and just make extra work for people already going out of their way to be helpful.
