  <p>In coding, very little of what you learn is unrelated to the rest of your work. All the information you acquire fits together like building blocks, and javascript is a great example of this. My first coding language was java, learned on a whim through khan academy. I learned the basics of coding logic and many of the fundamental parts of each coding language. My next coding language was python, for a class. The terminology was different, but the layout and basic functions were about the same, and while learning that language I realized just how important a fundamental understanding of computers is. The languages can change, and you may need to learn slightly different keywords while coding, but the logic never changes. Javascript is not my first coding language, and it will not be my last, but it will help me better understand coding, so that when I do end up learning another language, I can use it better than all the languages Iâ€™ve used in the past. Javascript may be similar to many languages, but just like all the others, it is unique in its own way. Functions can pass functions, functions can return any value, regardless of type, making it very useful for software engineering, decreasing bloat with much more streamlined code. All of these changes have logic and reasoning behind them, and every new feature helps me better understand how I can improve my coding and better utilize other languages in the future.</p>
